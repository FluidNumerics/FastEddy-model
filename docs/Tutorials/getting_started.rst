Introduction
============

`FastEddy`_ is a resident-GPU large eddy simulation (LES) model owned by the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (`NSF NCAR <https://ncar.ucar.edu>`_) Research Applications Laboratory (`RAL`_). It is designed for future turbulence-resolving numerical weather prediction.

This is a tutorial designed so that a user can learn how to execute FastEddy, using the four test cases described in this tutorial. 


Software and computing requirements
===================================

Computing resources with at least four general purpose graphics processing units are recommended to carry out the test cases. The system must be enabled with Python and Jupyter notebook packages. 

See :ref:`run_fasteddy` for instructions on how to build and run FastEddy on NSF NCAR's High Performance Computing machines.
